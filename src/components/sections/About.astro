            So here's the thing - I'm 22, studying engineering at Sri Krishna College of Technology, and I stumbled into coding almost by accident. Best accident ever, honestly.
          </p>
          
          <p class="cursor-target text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            It all started with this random idea to build a website for house interior designs. I had zero clue what I was doing, just me, some HTML, CSS, and way too much coffee. But when I saw my messy code actually create something beautiful on screen? Man, that was it. I was hooked.
          </p>
          
          <p class="cursor-target text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            What gets me excited isn't just the coding part - it's solving real problems. Like, when someone says "this process is so frustrating," I'm already thinking about how to build something that makes their day easier. JWT authentication, smooth UIs, whatever it takes.
          </p>
          
          <p class="cursor-target text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Right now I'm juggling my 7.4 GPA (proud of that one!) with internships and side projects. Always learning something new because, let's be real, tech never stops moving and neither do I.
